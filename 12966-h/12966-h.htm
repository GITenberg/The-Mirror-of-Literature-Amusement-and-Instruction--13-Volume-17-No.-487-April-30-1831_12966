<h2>BIRTHPLACE OF LOCKE.</h2>
<p>At the village of Wrington, in Somersetshire, in a cottage by
the churchyard, was born JOHN LOCKE. What a simple, unostentatious
record is this of him whom the biographers call &ldquo;one of the
most eminent philosophers and valuable writers of his age and
country.&rdquo; Yet the cottage is not preserved with any special
care;&mdash;there is nothing about it to denote that within its
walls the man of whom every Englishman is proud&mdash;first drew
breath. The house is now divided into tenements; and, fortuitously,
one of its rooms is used as a school for young children. It is
grateful to know this, even were it only for associating the
appropriation of this apartment with the master-mind of Locke, as
developed in his &ldquo;Thoughts on Education,&rdquo; and his
perspicuous &ldquo;Essay on the Human Understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locke was born August 29, 1632: his father, Mr. J. Locke, who
was descended from the Lockes of Charton Court, in Dorsetshire,
possessed a moderate landed property at Pensfold and Belluton,
where he lived. He was a captain in the Parliamentary army during
the civil wars, and his fortune suffered so considerably in those
times, that he left a smaller estate to his son than he himself had
inherited. It is not our intention to follow the biographers of
Locke further than by quoting from the last published Life of the
Philosopher<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> a brief example of his filial
affection:&mdash;</p>
<p>John Locke, says the biographer, was the eldest of two sons, and
was educated with great care by his father, of whom he always spoke
with the greatest respect and affection. In the early part of his
life, his father exacted the utmost respect from his son, but
gradually treated him with less and less reserve, and, when grown
up, lived with him on terms of the most entire friendship; so much
so, that Locke mentioned the fact of his father having expressed
his regret for giving way to his anger, and striking him once in
his childhood, when he did not deserve it. In a letter to a friend,
written in the latter part of his life, Locke thus expresses
himself on the conduct of a father <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page290" name="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span>towards his
son:&mdash;&ldquo;That which I have often blamed as an indiscreet
and dangerous practice in many fathers, viz. to be very indulgent
to their children whilst they are little, and as they come to ripe
years to lay great restraint upon them, and live with greater
reserve towards them, which usually produces an ill understanding
between father and son, which cannot but be of bad consequences;
and I think fathers would generally do better, as their sons grow
up, to take them into a nearer familiarity, and live with them with
as much freedom and friendship as their age and temper will
allow.&rdquo; The following letter from Locke to his father, which
is without a date, but must have been written before 1660, shows
the feeling of tenderness and affection which subsisted between
them. It was probably found by Locke amongst his father&rsquo;s
papers, and thus came again into his possession:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;December 20.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Most dear and ever-loving Father</em>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not doubt but that the noise of a very dangerous
sickness here would reach you, but I am alarmed with a more
dangerous disease from Pensford, and were I as secure of your
health as (I thank God) I am of my own, I should not think myself
in danger; but I cannot be safe so long as I hear of your weakness,
and that increase of your malady upon you, which I beg that you
would, by the timely application of remedies, endeavour to remove.
Dr. Meary has more than once put a stop to its
encroachment;&mdash;the same skill, the same means, the same God to
bless you, is left still. Do not, I beseech you, by that care you
ought to have of yourself, by that tenderness I am sure you have of
us, neglect your own and our safety too; do not, by a too pressing
care for your children, endanger the only comfort they have left. I
cannot distrust that Providence which hath conducted us thus far,
and if either your disappointments or necessities shall reduce us
to narrower conditions than you could wish, content shall enlarge
it; therefore, let not these thoughts distress you. There is
nothing that I have which can be so well employed as to his use,
from whom I first received it; and if your convenience can leave me
nothing else, I shall have a head, and hands, and industry still
left me, which alone have been able to raise sufficient fortunes.
Pray, sir, therefore, make your life as comfortable and lasting as
you can; let not any consideration of us cast you into the least
despondency. If I have any reflections on, or desires of free and
competent subsistence, it is more in reference to another (whom you
may guess) to whom I am very much obliged, than for myself: but no
thoughts, how important soever, shall make me forget my duty; and a
father is more than all other relations; and the greatest
satisfaction I can propose to myself in the world, is my hopes that
you may yet live to receive the return of some comfort, for all
that care and indulgence you have placed in,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, your most obedient son,</p>
<p>&ldquo;J.L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locke, it appears, originally applied himself to the study of
physic; and he became essentially serviceable in his medical
capacity to Lord Ashley, afterwards the celebrated Earl of
Shaftesbury, to whom he was introduced in 1666, and who was led to
form so high an opinion of Locke&rsquo;s general powers, that he
prevailed upon Locke to take up his residence at his house, and
urged him to apply his studies to politics and philosophy. This
proved the stepping-stone to his subsequent greatness; and it is
gratifying to learn that his career, literary and political, was
closed as honourably as it had been commenced. His last
publications were in a controversy with the celebrated Bishop
Stillingfleet, who had censured some passages in Locke&rsquo;s
immortal &ldquo;Essay.&rdquo; The prelate yielded to the more
powerful reasoning of the philosopher, yet Locke&rsquo;s writing
was uniformly distinguished by mildness and urbanity. At this time
he held the post of commissioner of trade and plantations. An
asthmatic complaint, with which he had long been afflicted, now
began to increase, and, with the rectitude which distinguished the
whole of his conduct, he resigned: the sovereign, (William) was
very unwilling to receive Locke&rsquo;s resignation; but the
philosopher, who made his precepts his own rule of life, pressed
the point, observing that he could not in conscience hold a
situation to which a considerable salary was attached without
performing the duties of it. Would that such political philosophy
were more common in our days! From this time, Locke lived wholly in
retirement, where he applied himself to the study of the
Scriptures, till, in 1704, after nearly two years&rsquo; declining
health, he fell asleep. He was buried at Oates, where there is a
neat monument erected to his memory, with a modest Latin
inscription indited by himself.</p>

<h3>CORFE CASTLE&mdash;EDWARD II.</h3>
<h4>(<em>To the Editor.</em>)</h4>
<p>I should be glad to be informed by your correspondent, <em>James
Silvester, Sen.</em>, on what authority he grounds his assertion
(contained in No. 484.) that it was in the fortress of <em>Corfe
Castle</em> that the unfortunate Edward II. was so inhumanly
murdered. I have always, considered it an undisputed fact that the
scene of this atrocity was at Berkeley Castle, in Gloucestershire.
Hume states, that while in the custody of Lord Berkeley, the
murderers, Mautravers and Gournay, &ldquo;taking advantage of
Berkeley&rsquo;s sickness, <em>in whose custody he then was, came
to Berkeley Castle</em>, threw him on a bed,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.
giving the particulars of the cruel deed. An abridged history, the
only other authority I have at hand to refer to, says, &ldquo;After
these transactions, he was treated with the greatest indignities,
and at last inhumanly murdered <em>in Berkeley Castle</em>, and his
body buried in a private manner in the Abbey Church, at
Gloucester.&rdquo; The lines of Gray, in his celebrated poem of
&ldquo;<em>The Bard</em>,&rdquo; are familiar to most school-boys,
where he alludes to the cries of the suffering monarch</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through <em>Berkeley&rsquo;s roofs</em> that ring Shrieks
of an agonized king!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet as your correspondent, <em>J.S.</em> seems of the
intelligent kind, he may be in possession of some authority to
which he can refer, and thereby prove it is not merely an assertion
inadvertently given, to increase the interest of his <em>Visit to
Corfe Castle</em>. Knowing your wish that the pages of your
entertaining <em>Mirror</em> should reflect the truth, the
insertion of this will oblige your Constant Reader,</p>
<p>W.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT BOROUGH OF WENDOVER.</h3>
<h4>(<em>For the Mirror.</em>)</h4>
<p>This borough sent members to parliament in the 28th of Edward I.
and again in the 1st and 2nd of Edward II.; after which the
privilege was discontinued for above three hundred years.
&ldquo;The intermission, (says Britton,) was attended by the very
remarkable circumstance of all recollection of the right of the
borough having been lost, till about the period of the 21st of
James I. when Mr. Hakeville, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, discovered by
a search among the ancient parliament writs in the Tower, that the
boroughs of Amersham, Wendover, and Great Marlow, had all sent
members in former times, and petitions were then preferred in the
names of those places, that their ancient liberty or franchise
might be restored. When the King<a id="footnotetag5" name=
"footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> was
informed of these petitions, he directed his solicitor, Sir Robert
Heath, to oppose them with all might, declaring, that he was
troubled with too great a number of burgesses already,&rdquo; The
sovereign&rsquo;s opposition proved ineffectual, and the Commons
decided in favour of the restoration of the privilege. Some
particulars of this singular case may be found in Willis&rsquo;s
<em>Notitia Parliamentaria</em>.</p>
<p>The celebrated John Hampden represented this borough in five
parliaments.</p>

<h3>HIPPODROME GAMES.</h3>
<h4>(<em>For the Mirror.</em>)</h4>
<p>The Olympian <em>Hippodrome</em>, or horse-course, was a space
of ground of six hundred paces long, surrounded with a wall, near
the city of Elis, and on the banks of the river Alpheus. It was
uneven, and in some degree irregular, on account of the
situation;&mdash;in one part was a hill of moderate height; and the
circuit was adorned with temples, altars, and other embellishments.
There was a very famous <em>hippodrome</em> at Constantinople,
which was begun by Alexander Severus, and finished by Constantine.
This circus, called by the Turks <em>atmeican</em>, is four hundred
paces long, and above one hundred paces wide. At the entrance of
the hippodrome there is a pyramidical obelisk of granite, in one
piece, about fifty feet high, terminating in a point, and charged
with hieroglyphics. The Greek and Latin inscriptions on its base
show that it was erected by Theodosius. The machines that were
employed to raise it are represented upon it in basso-relievo. We
have some vestiges in England of the <em>hippodromus</em>, in which
the ancient inhabitants of this country performed their races. The
most remarkable is that near Stonehenge, which is a long tract of
ground, about three hundred and fifty feet, or two hundred Druid
cubits wide, and more than a mile and three quarters, or six
thousand Druid cubits in length, enclosed quite round with a bank
of earth, extending directly east and west. The goal and career are
at the east end. The goal is a high bank of earth, raised with a
slope inwards, on which the judges are supposed to have sat. The
met&aelig; are two tumuli, or small barrows, at the west end of the
course. These <em>hippodromes</em> were called, in the language of
the country, <em>rhedagua</em>; the racer, <em>rhedagwr</em>; and
the carriage, <em>rheda</em>&mdash;from the British word rhedeg, to
run.</p>
<p>One of these <em>hippodromes</em>, about half a mile to the
southward of Leicester, retains evident traces of the old name,
<em>rhedagua</em> in the corrupted one of Rawdikes. &ldquo;There is
another of these,&rdquo; says Dr. Stukely, &ldquo;near Dorchester;
and another on the banks of the river Lowther, near Penrith, in
Cumberland; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name=
"page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>and another in the valley just without
the town of Royston.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE BEGGAR WOMAN OF LOCARNO.</h3>
<p>At the foot of the Alps, near Locarno, was an old castle,
belonging to a marquess, the ruins of which are still visible to
the traveller, as he comes from St. Gothard&mdash;a castle with
lofty and roomy apartments, high towers, and narrow windows. In one
of these rooms, an old sick woman was deposited upon some straw,
which had been shaken down for her by the housekeeper of the
marquess, who had found her begging before the gate. The marquess,
who was accustomed to go into this room on his return from hunting,
to lay aside his gun, ordered the poor wretch to get up immediately
out of her corner, and begone.</p>
<p>The creature arose, but slipping with her crutch upon the smooth
floor, she fell, and injured her back so much, that it was with
great difficulty she got up, and, moving across the room as she had
been desired, groaning and crying sadly, sank down behind the
chimney. Several years afterwards, when the circumstances of the
marquess had been much reduced by war and the failure of his crops,
a Florentine gentleman visited the castle, with the intention of
purchasing it, in consequence of the beauty of the situation. The
marquess, who was very anxious to have the bargain concluded, gave
his wife directions to lodge the stranger in the same upper room in
which the old woman had died, it having, in the meantime, been very
handsomely fitted up; but, to their consternation, in the middle of
the night, the stranger entered their room, pale and agitated,
protesting loudly that the chamber was haunted by some invisible
being; for that he had heard something rise up in the corner, as if
it had been lying among straw, move over the chamber with slow and
tottering steps, and sink down, groaning and crying, near the
chimney.</p>
<p>The marquess, terrified, though he scarcely knew why,
endeavoured to put a fair face upon the matter, and to laugh off
the fears of his visiter, telling him he would rise himself, and
spend the rest of the night with him in his room; but the stranger
begged that he would rather allow him to occupy a couch in the
adjoining room; and as soon as morning broke, he saddled his horse,
took his leave, and departed. This occurrence, which occasioned
much notice, made so unpleasant an impression upon intending
purchasers, that not another inquiry was made; and at last, even
the servants in the house becoming possessed with the notion that
there was something dreadful in the room, the marquess, with the
view of setting the report to rest, determined to investigate the
matter himself next night. Accordingly, in the twilight, he caused
his bed to be brought to the apartment, and waited, without
sleeping, the approach of midnight. But what was his consternation,
when, on the stroke of midnight, he actually heard some
inconceivable noise in the apartment, as if some person had risen
up from among straw, which rustled beneath them, walked slowly over
the floor, and sank, sighing and groaning, behind the chimney. When
he came down the next morning, the marchesa asked him how the
investigation had gone on; and he, after gazing about him with
wondering glances, and bolting the door, told her the story of the
chamber&rsquo;s being haunted was true. She was terrified out of
her senses; but begged him, before making any public disclosure,
once more to make the experiment coolly in her company. Accompanied
by a trusty servant, they accordingly repeated their visit next
night, and again heard, as the marquess had done before, the same
ghostly and inconceivable noise; and nothing but the anxious wish
to get rid of the castle, cost what it would, enabled them to
suppress their terrors in presence of the servant, and to ascribe
the sound to some accidental cause. On the evening of the third
day, when both, determined to probe the matter to the bottom, were
ascending with beating hearts the stair leading to the
stranger&rsquo;s apartment, it chanced that the house dog, who had
been let loose from the chain, was lying directly before the door
of the room; and, willing perhaps to have the company of any other
living thing in the mysterious apartment, they took the dog into
the room along with them. The husband and wife seated themselves on
the couch&mdash;the marquess with his sword and pistols beside him;
and while they endeavoured, the best way they could, to amuse
themselves with conversation, the dog, cowering down on the floor
at their feet, fell asleep. Again, with the stroke of midnight, the
noise was renewed;&mdash;something, though what they could not
discover, raised itself us if with crutches <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span>in the
corner; the straw rustled as before. At the sound of the first
foot-fall, the dog awoke, roused itself, pricked up its ears, and
growling and barking as if some person were advancing towards him,
retreated in the direction of the chimney. At this sight, the
marchioness rushed out of the room, her hair standing on end; and
while the marquess seized his sword, exclaimed &ldquo;Who is
there?&rdquo; and receiving no answer, thrust like a madman in all
directions, she hastily packed up a few articles of dress, and made
the best of her way towards the town. Scarcely, however, had she
proceeded a few steps, when she discovered that the castle was on
fire. The marquess had, in his distraction, overturned the tapers,
and the room was instantly in flames. Every effort was made to save
the unhappy nobleman, but in vain: he perished in the utmost
tortures, and his bones, as the traveller may be aware, still lie
where they were collected by the neighbouring peasants&mdash;in the
corner of the apartment from which he had expelled the beggar woman
of Locarno.&mdash;<em>Edinburgh Literary Journal and

<h2>SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.</h2>

<h3>HYDROSTATICS AND PNEUMATICS.</h3>
<h4>(<em>Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</em>, vol. xvii.)</h4>
<p>This volume is in every respect worthy of standing beside the
luminous <em>Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy</em>, by
Mr. Herschel. It is just in the method that we wish to see all
branches of science treated, and it is the only means of rendering
such knowledge familiar; and this has only to be known to become
popular. We understood this to be the aim of the <em>Cabinet
Cyclop&aelig;dia</em> at its outset, and the scientific volumes
already published are an earnest of the Editor&rsquo;s zeal and
success. The best method of illustrating this recommendation, is to
seize from the volume a few familiar effects whose causes are
imperfectly understood, and thus to show how closely the spread of
science is identified with civilization and the common comforts of
social life:&mdash;</p>
<p><em>Deceptive appearance of Waves</em></p>
<p>If we observe the waves continually approaching the shore, we
must be convinced that this apparent motion is not one in which the
water has any share: for were it so, the waters of the sea would
soon be heaped upon the shores, and would inundate the adjacent
country; but so far from the waters partaking of the apparent
motion of the waves in approaching the shore, this motion of the
waves continues, even when the waters are retiring. If we observe a
flat strand when the tide is ebbing, we shall still find the waves
moving towards the shore.</p>
<p><em>Ornamental Fountain Clocks.</em></p>
<p>It is the same cause (that which produces the deceptive
appearance of a progressive motion in the waves of the sea) which
makes a revolving cork-screw, held in a fixed position, seem to be
advancing in that direction in which it would actually advance if
the worm were passing through a cork. That point which is nearest
to the eye, and which corresponds to the crest of the wave in the
former example, continually occupies a different point of the worm,
and continually advances towards its extremity.&mdash;This property
has lately been prettily applied in ornamental clocks. A piece of
glass, twisted so that its surface acquires a ridge in the form of
a screw, is inserted in the mouth of some figure designed to
represent a fountain. One end of the glass is attached to the axle
of a wheel, which the clock-work keeps in a state of constant
rotation, and the other end is concealed in a vessel, designed to
represent a reservoir or basin. The continual rotation of the
twisted glass produces the appearance of a progressive motion, as
already explained, and a stream of water continually appears to
flow from the fountain into the basin.</p>
<p><em>Facility of Swimming.</em></p>
<p>The lighter the body is in relation to its magnitude, the more
easily will it float, and a greater proportion of the head will
remain above the surface. As the weight of the human body does not
always bear the same proportion to its bulk, the skill of the
swimmer is not always to be estimated by his success; some of the
constituent parts of the human body are heavier, while others are
lighter, bulk for bulk, than water. Those persons in whom the
quantity of the latter bear a greater proportion to the former,
will swim with a proportionate facility.</p>
<p><em>Common Mistake in Cooling Wine.</em></p>
<p>When ice is used to cool wine, it will be ineffectual if it be
applied, as is frequently the case, only to the bottom of the
bottle; in that case, the only part of the wine which will be
cooled is that part nearest the bottom. As the application of ice
to the top of the bottle <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295"
name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>establishes two currents, upwards
and downwards, the liquid will undergo an effect in some degree
similar to that which would be produced by shaking the bottle. If
there be any deposit in the bottom whose weight, bulk for bulk,
nearly equals that of the wine, such deposit will be mixed through
the liquid as effectually as if it had been shaken. In such cases,
therefore, the wine should be transferred into a clean bottle
before it is cooled.</p>
<p><em>Why Cream collects on the surface of Milk.</em></p>
<p>There are numerous familiar effects which are manifestations of
the principle now explained. When a vessel of milk is allowed to
remain a certain time at rest, it is observed that a stratum of
fluid will collect at the surface, differing in many qualities from
that upon which it rests. This is called <em>cream</em>; and the
property by which it ascends to the surface is its relative levity;
it is composed of the lightest particles of the milk, which are in
the first instance mixed generally in the fluid; but which, when
the liquid is allowed to rest, gradually arise through it, and
settle at the surface.</p>
<p><em>Directions engraved upon the Common Weather Glasses
absurd.</em></p>
<p>The barometer has been called a <em>weather glass</em>. Rules
are attempted to be established, by which, from the height of the
mercury, the coming state of the weather may be predicted, and we
accordingly find the words &ldquo;Rain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Changeable,&rdquo; &ldquo;Frost,&rdquo; &amp;c., engraved on
the scale attached to common domestic barometers, as if, when the
mercury stands at the height marked by these words, the weather is
always subject to the vicissitudes expressed by them. These marks
are, however, entitled to no attention; and it is only surprising
to find their use continued in the present times, when knowledge is
so widely diffused. They are, in fact, to be ranked scarcely above
the <em>vox stellarum</em>, or astrological almanac.</p>
<p>Two barometers, one near the level of the River Thames, and the
other on the heights of Hampstead, will differ by half an inch; the
latter being always half an inch lower than the former. If the
words, therefore, engraved upon the plates are to be relied on,
similar changes of weather could never happen at these two
situations. But what is even more absurd, such a scale would inform
us that the weather at the foot of a high building, such as St.
Paul&rsquo;s, must always be different from the weather at the top
of it.</p>
<p>It is observed that the changes of weather are indicated, not by
the actual height of the mercury, but by its <em>change</em> of
height. One of the most general, though not absolutely invariable,
rules is, that when the mercury is very low, and therefore the
atmosphere very light, high winds and storms may be expected.</p>
<p>The following rules may generally be relied upon, at least to a
certain extent:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Generally</em> the rising of the mercury indicates the
approach of fair weather; the falling of it shows the approach of
foul weather.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In sultry weather the fall of the mercury indicates coming
thunder. In winter, the rise of the mercury indicates frost. In
frost, its fall indicates thaw; and its rise indicates snow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever change of weather suddenly follows a change in the
barometer, may be expected to last but a short time. Thus, if fair
weather follow immediately the rise of the mercury, there will be
very little of it; and, in the same way if foul weather follow the
fall of the mercury, it will last but a short time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If fair weather continue for several days, during which the
mercury continually falls, a long continuance of foul weather will
probably ensue; and again, if foul weather continue for several
days, while the mercury continually rises, it long succession of
fair weather will probably succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fluctuating and unsettled state in the mercurial column
indicates changeable weather.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The domestic barometer would become a much more useful
instrument, if, instead of the words usually engraved on the plate,
a short list of the best established rules, such as the above,
accompanied it, which might be either engraved on the plate, or
printed on a card. It would be right, however, to express the rules
only with that degree of probability which observation of past
phenomena has justified. There is no rule respecting these effects
which will hold good with perfect certainty in every case.</p>
<p>This volume, we should add, is by Dr. Lardner, the editor of the
<em>Cyclop&aelig;dia</em>, and is a good model for his
collaborateurs.</p>

<h3>REFLECTION.</h3>
<p>It is better to reflect ourselves, than to suffer others to
reflect for us. A philosopher has a system; he views things
according to his theory; he is unavoidably partial; and, like
Lucian&rsquo;s painter, he paints his one-eyed princes in
profile.</p>

"STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT." /></a></div>
<h2>STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT.</h2>
<p>This superb work of modern art stands in one of the finest
squares of St. Petersburgh, and of Europe, according to Sir Robert
Ker Porter. It was erected by command of the Empress Catherine,
and, like all her projects, bears the stamp of greatness. The name
of the artist is Falconet: &ldquo;he was a Frenchman; but,&rdquo;
adds Sir R.K.P. &ldquo;this statue, for genius and exquisite
execution, would have done honour to the best sculptors of any
nation. A most sublime conception is displayed in the design. The
allegory is finely imagined; and had he not sacrificed the result
of the whole to the prominence of his group, the grand and united
effect of the statue and its pedestal striking at once upon the
eye, would have been unequalled in the works of man. A mass of
granite, of a size at present most immense, but formerly most
astonishing, is the pedestal. A steep acclivity, like that of a
rugged mountain, carries the eye to its summit, which looks down on
the opposite side to a descent nearly perpendicular. The figure of
the hero is on horseback, supposed to have attained the object of
his ambition, by surmounting all the apparent impossibilities which
so arduous an enterprise presented. The victorious animal is
proudly rearing on the highest point of the rock, whilst his
imperial master stretches forth his mighty arm, as the father and
protector of his country. A serpent, in attempting to impede his
course, is trampled on by the feet of the horse, and writhing in
all the agonies of expiring nature. The Emperor is seated on the
skin of a bear; and habited in a tunic, or sort of toga which forms
the drapery behind. His left hand guides the reins; his right is
advanced straight forward on the same side of the horse&rsquo;s
neck. The head of the statue is crowned with a laurel
wreath.&rdquo; It was formed from a bust of Peter, modelled by a
young French damsel. The contour of the face expresses the most
powerful command, and exalted, boundless, expansion of thought.
&ldquo;The horse, says Sir Robert, is not to be surpassed. To all
the beauties of the ancient form, it unites the easy grace of
nature with a fire which pervades every line; and gives such a life
to the statue, that as you gaze you expect to see it leap from the
pinnacle into the air. The difficulty of keeping so great a mass of
weighty metal in so volant an attitude, has been admirably overcome
by the artist. The sweep of the tail, with the hinder parts of the
horse, are interwoven with the curvatures of the expiring snake;
and together compose a sufficient counterpoise to the figure and
forepart of the animal.&rdquo;<a id="footnotetag6" name=
"footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Our representation of this masterpiece of art is copied from a
Russian medallion presented to our ingenious artist, Mr. W.H.
Brooke, by M. Francia.</p>

<h3>SIR JOHN HAWKINS&rsquo;S HISTORY OF MUSIC.</h3>
<p>The fate of this work was decided like that of many more
important things, by a trifle, a word, a pun. A ballad, chanted by
a fille-de-chambre, undermined the colossal power of Alberoni; a
single line of Frederic the Second, reflecting not on the politics
but the poetry of a French minister, plunged France into the seven
years&rsquo; war; and a pun condemned Sir John Hawkins&rsquo;s
sixteen years&rsquo; labour to long obscurity and oblivion. Some
wag wrote the following catch, which Dr. Callcott set to
music:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you read Sir John Hawkins&rsquo;s History? Some
folks think it quite a mystery; Both I have, and I aver That
Burney&rsquo;s History I prefer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Burn his History</em> was straightway in every one&rsquo;s
mouth; and the bookseller, if he did not follow the advice
<em>&agrave; pied de la lettre</em>, actually wasted, as the term
is, or sold for waste paper, some hundred copies, and buried the
rest of the impression in the profoundest depth of a damp cellar,
as an article never likely to be called for, so that now hardly a
copy can be procured undamaged by damp and mildew. It has been for
some time, however, rising,&mdash;is rising,&mdash;and the more it
is read and known, the more it ought to rise in public estimation
and demand.&mdash;<em>Harmonicon</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ITALIAN, AT THE KING&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h3>
<p>A Liberal and sensible correspondent of the <em>Harmonicon</em>
writes thus:</p>
<p>Mrs. Wood is not the first of our countrywomen who has attained
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>[pg
298]</span>same rank; the names of Billington, Cecilia Davies
(called <em>Inglesina</em>,) and in remoter times, that of
Anastasia Robinson, (afterwards Countess of Peterborough,) will
immediately occur to the musical reader; but, with the exception of
the latter, who lived at a time when the Italian opera in England
was in its infancy, Mrs. Wood is, if I mistake not, the first
Englishwoman who has achieved that distinction without a
certificate of character from Italy. Even Billington was not
thought worthy of our opera stage until she had delighted the
audiences of San Carlo, the Scala, and the Fenice. Mrs. Wood, on
the other hand, is our own, and wholly our own; she has not basked
in the suns of Naples, nor breathed the musical atmosphere of
Venice or Milan; yet I, who am an old stager, like Iago,
&ldquo;nothing if not critical,&rdquo; and have heard every
<em>prima donna</em> from Billington down to this present writing,
have seldom uttered any <em>brava</em> with more unction than when
listening to Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s <em>Angelina</em> and
<em>Ottavia</em>.</p>
<p>My intent is to hail Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s appearance and success at
the opera as an <em>auspicium melioris &aelig;vi</em>, as the dawn
of a coming day, when the staple commodity of our Italian opera
shall be furnished by our own island, instead of being imported
from a country which, I boldly assert, does not produce either
superior voices, or better educated musicians than our
own&mdash;nay, so well educated. Has Italy ever furnished us with
such a tenor singer as Braham; the Braham that I am, <em>per mia
disgrazia</em>, qualified, by age, to remember; the Braham of 1801?
Has Italy ever sent us a <em>prima donna</em>, considered as a
singer only, like Billington? On the contrary, do we not, in
gauging our progressive musical importations, subject them to
immediate comparison with Billington and Braham? And who, except
Catalani and Fodor, Siboni and Donzelli, would bear that
comparison? The French, the Germans, cultivate assiduously native
talent, and we import, now a Fodor, and now a Sontag; we English
alone persist in the sapient policy of making the exclusion of the
native artist from the highest point to which his ambition could be
directed, the rule; and his admission, the exception which the
grammarians say (though my grammar-master never could drive it into
my head why) proves the rule.</p>
<p>But I shall be told that few of our native artists can speak the
Italian language, or sing Italian music, and more especially
recitative. My answer is, let them once know that the mere
circumstance of their being English born does not shut the
stage-door of the King&rsquo;s Theatre against them, all will look
up to its boards as the goal of their ambition, and the study of
Italian and recitative will form an important part of every
singer&rsquo;s education. Another common objection is, that we
cannot acquire the purity of pronunciation required by the refined
audience of the King&rsquo;s Theatre. I trust it is no heresy to
say that I am somewhat sceptical as to the powers of euphoniacal
criticism which that audience possesses. If one in ten, even of the
box company, can really distinguish the true <em>bocca romana</em>
from the patois of the Venetian gondolieri or the Neapolitan
lazzaroni, it is, I am persuaded, as much as the truth will
justify. In fact it is not the audience that is so critical: it is
the associated band of foreign parasites who attach themselves to
our aristocracy with the tenacity of leeches, as purveyors <em>des
menus plaisirs</em>, and whose interests are vitally concerned in
excluding English talent, and negotiating the concerns of foreign
artists, that raise the cry of &ldquo;pronunciation.&rdquo; It is
these gentry who, in phrase that a Tuscan would spurn at, and in a
brogue from which a Roman, ear would be averted with disgust,
assure our fashionable opera goers that we poor Englishers cannot
learn to pronounce Italian.</p>
<p>But, after all, do we, by employing only
<em>foreigners</em>&mdash;for we are not particular, so they be
foreigners, as to whether they were born and bred beyond, or on
this side the Alps,&mdash;do we, by employing only foreigners,
secure this essential purity of Italian pronunciation? Will these
super-delicate critics favour a plain man, by informing me which of
the great singers I have heard for the last thirty years I should
select as my canon of true Italian pronunciation&mdash;Catalani and
Camporese, or Garcia the Spaniard and Begrez the Fleming? There is
not more difference between the English, whether we look to
phraseology or pronunciation, of a Londoner, a Gloucestershire man,
or a Northumbrian, than there is between the Italian of a Tuscan, a
Venetian and a Neapolitan. Have the stage lamps of Drury Lane or
Covent Garden the virtue of curing the Northumbrian&rsquo;s burr,
or correcting the Gloucestershireman&rsquo;s invincible abhorrence
of <em>h</em>&rsquo;s and <em>w</em>&rsquo;s? If not, can we expect
that even the theatres of Rome and Florence will neutralize at once
the provincial accent of a Neapolitan or Venetian? Was it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>[pg
299]</span>in Morelli, the stable-boy, or Banti, the street
ballad-singer, that the beau ideal of pure Italian pronunciation
was to be recognised?</p>
<p>But, to be serious. I will venture to affirm that, on this side
the Alps, there is no country in Europe whose natives have so
little to learn, or to unlearn, in acquiring a good Italian
pronunciation, as the English. We have neither the gutturals of the
German and the Spaniard, nor the mute vowels and nasal
<em>n</em>&rsquo;s of the French to get rid of; there is scarcely a
sound in the Italian language which we are not in the daily habit
of uttering, and nearly our whole task would be confined to the
learning that certain conventional alphabetical symbols, which
represent one sound in English, represent another in Italian. Away,
then, with the jargonal pretence that English singers cannot
acquire a good and pure Italian pronunciation; make it worth their
while, open the stage-doors of the King&rsquo;s Theatre to the
native artist, and you will soon find talent more than enough.</p>

<h3>COINCIDENT POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>
<h4>(<em>Continued from page 284.</em>)</h4>
<p style="text-align:right;font-size:0.8em;">[Transcriber's note:
See Mirror 486]</p>
<p>Such is the tale, which is either of itself the fragment of some
popular superstition, or has given rise to many coincident legends.
&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; says the kind friend who furnished us with
the narrative, speaking of the Beresford from whom she received it,
&ldquo;that neither he, nor any of his relations, disbelieves the
statements recorded.&rdquo; Possibly not; nor dare we profess to be
utterly sceptical&mdash;simply as Christians&mdash;to all
narratives of this description; but, allowing the possibility, nay,
the necessity in some cases, of supernatural agency, still, a
spirit should have some just and striking reason for its permitted
appearance; and we cannot exactly discover the object of Sir
Tristram&rsquo;s mission. Would it be unfair to hazard a conjecture
that the lady, being a Catholic, married in Captain Georges a
Protestant (a supposition which the double performance of the
marriage ceremony with him seems to favour), whom, being anxious to
convert to her own faith, she thought to deceive, by the
&ldquo;cunningly devised fable&rdquo; of a spirit with a burning
hand, into the Papistical tenet of purgatory? and, that by a
confusion of real circumstances with her original fiction, is
derived the remarkable family tradition recorded? Leaving this
speculation for the private rumination of our readers, we
proceed:</p>
<p>The stories of the young lady suffocated by accidentally
enclosing herself in a chest with a spring lock<a id="footnotetag7"
name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>&mdash;of the girl frightened into
complete idiotcy by those who placed a skeleton, or, as some say, a
skull only, in her bed<a id="footnotetag8" name=
"footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>&mdash;and
of ladies, bishops, &amp;c. obtaining their livelihoods privately
by highway robbery<a id="footnotetag9" name=
"footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>, with
similar narratives, rather romantic than superstitious, are general
property, and to be met with under various modifications throughout
England. The tale of the King of the Cats<a id="footnotetag10"
name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>, a
German tradition, has its exact counterpart in an Irish one,
related to us as an original Hibernian legend, and published some
time since in an excellent work, which having now disappeared, we
may perhaps venture to give, as a novelty, the little tradition in
these pages:</p>
<p>A man passing, late at night, a ruined house, observed that it
was lighted, and heard a great mewing, as of a conclave of cats,
within. As he marvelled at the circumstance, a cat jumped upon one
of the broken walls, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Tell Dildrum that
Doldrum&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; The man, little dreaming of these
words being addressed to him, pursued his way home; where, when he
arrived, a good, fire, an excellent supper, and his wife&rsquo;s
conversation, seem to have banished for a time from his
recollection what he had seen and heard. At last, he began to laugh
so heartily that he was nearly choked, and his wife pressed him to
tell her the cause of his mirth. This he did; but no sooner had he
uttered the words &ldquo;Tell Dildrum that Doldrum&rsquo;s
dead,&rdquo; when his own favourite grimalkin, who had lent an
attentive ear to his narrative, whilst demurely basking before the
fire, started upon his feet, and exclaiming, &ldquo;O murder! and
is Doldrum dead?&rdquo; dashed up the chimney, and was never seen
more.</p>
<p>A Scottish tradition concerning The Cat o&rsquo; the Craigs, as
given by a correspondent in vol. iv. of the <em>Mirror</em>, p. 85,
and which has a most fatal termination, is evidently but another
version of the same story.</p>
<p>In a little work just published, on &ldquo;Cambrian
Superstitions,&rdquo; by Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300"
name="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>Howells, several are mentioned so
exactly similar to those prevalent in Ireland, Scotland, and
England, as to leave no doubt of their common origin. The Welsh
coast has also its spectre-ships, like America and the seas of the
Cape, ere shipwreck.</p>
<p>The <em>Mirror&rsquo;s</em> able correspondent VYVYAN has, in
vol. xii. p. 408, noticed the connexion between the German Peter
Klaus and Emperor Barbarossa, with the oriental Seven Sleepers and
the American Rip Von Winkle. We may add, that there is a similar
Welsh superstition respecting the enchanted slumber of King Arthur,
and his expected reappearance upon earth before the last day, to
take part in the holy wars of the times. The Poles and Turks, if we
mistake not, have among them a corresponding legend; and whilst Sir
W. Scott has given us that of the purchase of horses by Thomas the
Rhymour, and the magic slumbers of the gigantic men-at-arms
appointed to ride them, in the subterranean mews, H. has rescued
very happily from oblivion a coincident English superstition. The
legendary lore of mountainous and mining countries, is, with little
variation, the same; and whether America, Germany, Sweden,
Scotland, Wales, or our own peculiar mining districts in England be
the locale of such, still may be discovered, under different names
indeed, and circumstances, the demons of the mines, the guardians
of hidden treasures, the freakish dwarfs and fays, who delight in
unexpectedly enriching the poor and virtuous, whilst they delude
most miserably all idle and worthless treasure-seekers, &amp;c.
Nay, what, we may inquire, are the oriental genii of kings, and
lamps, &amp;c., but modifications of one and the same superstition?
And what are the said Ginns&mdash;who erect splendid palaces in the
course of a few brief hours, and transport them at pleasure from
place to place&mdash;but the Evil Ones of more modern times and
northern countries, who build, according to popular tradition,
bridges, and mills, &amp;c.?&mdash;who cleave mountains, excavate
ditches, and fly away with monasteries and hermitages, in an
incredibly short space of time?</p>
<p>However, we have finished; for less than a folio could not do
that justice to our subject in its various bearings which it
requires;&mdash;nor, indeed, would less than an intimate
acquaintance with all the tongues and traditions of all nations
that are, or ever have been, upon the face of the earth&mdash;so
intermingled are divine revelations, corrupt mythologies, wild and
palpable fictions, fantastic imaginings, exaggerated allegories,
poetical machinery, and the very insanity of human hopes, fears,
and wishes, &amp;c. &amp;c., in the great and never to be analyzed
body of popular superstition!</p>
<p>Can any of the readers of the <em>Mirror</em> throw additional
light on the subject of coincident traditions?&mdash;Can any of its
contributors show the connexion which subsists between oriental
mythology, allegory, and legendary lore, with that of the
Scandinavian nations? This Sir Walter Scott has omitted to
do;&mdash;but this might afford, even formed of the materials
to be gleaned from various desultory sources, another volume upon
&ldquo;Demonology and Witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>FINE ARTS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>COLONEL BATTY&rsquo;S VIEWS OF EUROPEAN CITIES.&mdash;NO.
IV.</h3>
<h4><em>Edinburgh.</em></h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen of the North&rdquo; has contributed five
majestic views to Colonel Batty&rsquo;s important Series. Each of
them is engraved &ldquo;in the first style of art,&rdquo; as a
prospectus would say, and there is no falling off in points of
interest from the Parts of this work which have already been
laudatorily noticed in the <em>Mirror</em>.</p>
<p>The Vignette of this Part is Edinburgh Castle, from the Grass
Market, in which the fine old fortress is seen towering in all its
picturesqueness and romantic beauty. Here and there it has some of
the indistinctness of hoar antiquity: its fadings away are
beautifully characteristic. The houses in the Grass Market are
boldly contrasted with the Castle, and the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;
inscriptions on the Stablers are as distinct as the most panting
soul could wish them. The Engraver is R. Brandard.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, from the Calton Hill, is the <em>first</em> view.
This is, as observed in the letter-press, &ldquo;the most
comprehensive view of Edinburgh, and we may add, one of the
grandest and most remarkable scenes in any city of Europe.&rdquo;
From this point of view, &ldquo;both the New and Old Cities, with
their communications, come at once under our observation; the neat
and handsome modern edifices of the New Town on the right hand,
contrast with the old grey piles of building on the left. The bold
slopes of the Pentland hills bound the distance on the left, while
the more gently indulated Corstorphine hills close the horizon on
the right.&rdquo; This description is <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page301" name="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>correct in its shades.
The murkiness and smoking chimneys of the Old Town are admirably
relieved by the splendid vistas of Princes-street and the New Town.
Upwards of twenty public buildings, most of them of great beauty,
may be distinctly counted in this scene. It is engraved in the best
style of Mr. George Cooke, one of the best <em>view</em> engravers
of the day.</p>
<p>The Calton Hill forms the <em>second</em> plate, showing those
splendid tributes of Scottish patriotism&mdash;the National
Monument, Playfair&rsquo;s Monument, and Nelson&rsquo;s Monument.
Would that we had some such site in or near our metropolis, whereon
we might offer up our tributes to departed genius. What an
honourable testimony of national gratitude is the monument to
Nelson! and how emblematic of &ldquo;the Modern Athens&rdquo; are
the fine classic columns of the National Monument. Playfair and the
Observatory Entrance remind us of Scotland&rsquo;s meteor-like
pride in modern science; and the beetling brows of Arthur&rsquo;s
Seat and Salisbury Crags over the lower portion of the Old City in
the valley below are well contrasted with these stately
embellishments of art. The plate is well engraved by J.H.
Kernot.</p>
<p>The New Royal High School, the <em>third</em> plate, is a superb
building, and merits especial notice, in association with the
intellectual character of the city. The Temple of Theseus, at
Athens, has furnished models for its beautiful columns. &ldquo;The
Regent Road, forming the new and noble entrance to Edinburgh,
serves as a terrace in its front.&rdquo; Here again the
indistinctness of the Old Town aids the fine effect of the new
buildings. This plate is for the most part brilliantly executed by
E. Goodall.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, from St. Anthony&rsquo;s Chapel, is the
<em>fourth</em> plate, and certainly not the least striking of the
whole, although its chief merit is in the distance, which, for
distinctness and delicacy, is admirable. Holyrood and its decaying
Chapel, seen from this point, are beautifully made out, and the
picturesque but massy form of the Castle fades away in the extreme
distance. The foreground is bold and bright, but the distant
details of the view are the charm of the picture. The engraver is
W.I. Cooke. &ldquo;The view of Edinburgh from this point will give
a correct idea of the relative situations of the Castle and Calton
Hill at opposite extremities of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edinburgh from the ascent to Anthony&rsquo;s Seat is the
<em>fifth</em> plate. Here we scarcely know which to admire most,
the beautiful work and etchy spirit of the mountainous foreground,
the minuteness and delicacy of the distant city, or the actual
brightness of the Firth of Forth broken by the &ldquo;noble
breast-work of Salisbury Crags and the point of the Cat&rsquo;s
nick.&rdquo; The Crags, it will be recollected, are about 550 feet
above the level of the Firth of Forth: a few sheep lie scattered
about them, and the part of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat on the left; the
straggling pedestrians in the path to the Cat Nick are of
emmet-like proportions. This plate is by W.R. Smith.</p>
<p>By the way, what a delightful Series will be these views of
European cities for the walls of a cheerful breakfast parlour, or
to alternate with well-filled cases of books. How pleasant it will
be to sit in one&rsquo;s arm-chair, and look around upon &ldquo;the
principal cities of Europe.&rdquo; We say &ldquo;for the
walls,&rdquo; since these Prints are too valuable to be hid in
folios, or pasted in albums. Frame-work, we know, is an expensive
affair; but Colonel Batty&rsquo;s Views are worthy of oak and gold;
and a good plan is to put them in one broad oak or maple frame,
with gold moulding, dividing the views by bar-work. They will be
then both elegant and intellectual furniture.</p>

<h2>THE SELECTOR;<br />
AND LITERARY NOTICES OF<br />
<em>NEW WORKS</em>.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>ANGLO-SAXON HISTORY.</h3>
<p>It appears that the <em>Family Library</em>, as well as the
<em>Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</em>, is to have its own <em>History
of England;</em> since the 21st &ldquo;Family&rdquo; volume is the
first of such a History, and comprises the Anglo-Saxon period, from
the pen of that distinguished antiquarian scholar, Francis
Palgrave, Esq. F.R.S. &amp;c. The portion before us, as our readers
may imagine, is extremely interesting: it is well studded or
sprinkled with origins and antiquities popularly illustrated, and
has little or none of the dryness of an antiquarian pen. We quote
two such passages, and especially direct the attention of the
reader to our third extract, relative to the early influence of
Christianity:&mdash;</p>
<p><em>Stonehenge.</em></p>
<p>The temples in which the Britons worshipped their Deities, were
composed of large, rough stones, disposed in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>[pg
302]</span>circles; for they had not sufficient skill to execute
any finished edifices. Some of these circles are yet existing; such
is Stonehenge, near Salisbury: the huge masses of rock may still be
seen there, grey with age; and the structure is yet sufficiently
perfect to enable us to understand how the whole pile was anciently
arranged. Stonehenge possesses a stern and savage magnificence. The
masses of which it is composed are so large, that the structure
seems to have been raised by more than human power. Hence,
<em>Choir-gaur</em><a id="footnotetag11" name=
"footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> was
fabled to have been built by giants, or otherwise constructed by
magic art. All around you in the plain, you will see mounds of
earth or &ldquo;tumuli,&rdquo; beneath which the Britons buried
their dead. Antiquaries have sometimes opened these mounds, and
there they have discovered vases, containing the ashes and the
bones of the primeval Britons, together with their swords and
hatchets, and arrow-heads of flint or of bronze, and beads of glass
and amber; for the Britons probably believed, that the dead yet
delighted in those things which had pleased them when they were
alive, and that the disembodied spirit retained the inclinations
and affections of mortality.</p>
<p><em>London in the Seventeenth Century.</em></p>
<p>London was quite unlike the great metropolis which we now
inhabit. Its extent was confined to what is now termed &ldquo;the
city,&rdquo; then surrounded by a wall, built, as it is supposed,
about the age of Constantine, and of which a few fragments are
existing. All around was open country. Towards the north-east a
deep marsh,&mdash;the name is yet preserved in
Moorfields,&mdash;extended to the foot of the Roman ramparts. On
the western side of the city, and at the distance of nearly two
miles, the branches of a small river which fell into the Thames
formed an island, so overgrown with thickets and brushwood, that
the Saxons called it &ldquo;<em>Thorney</em>,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Isle of Thorns.&rdquo; The river surrounding Thorney crept
sullenly along the plashy soil; and the spot was so wild and
desolate, that it is described as a fearful and terrible place,
which no one could approach after nightfall without great danger.
In this island there had been an ancient Roman temple, consecrated
to Apollo. And Sebert, perhaps on account of the seclusion which
Thorney afforded, resolved to build a church on the site, and he
dedicated the fabric to St. Peter the Apostle. This church is now
Westminster Abbey; the busy city of Westminster is old Thorney
Island, that seat of desolation; and the bones of Sebert yet rest
in the structure which he founded. Another great church was built
by Sebert, in the city of London, upon the ruins of the heathen
temple of Diana. This church is now St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral; and
Mellitus being appointed the first Bishop by Ethelbert and Sebert,
the succession has continued to the present day.</p>
<p><em>Influence of Christianity.</em></p>
<p>Before a century had elapsed, Christianity was firmly and
sincerely believed throughout Anglo-Saxon Britain; and, in the
state of society which then prevailed, the establishment of the
true religion became the means of conferring the greatest temporal
advantages upon the community. A large proportion of the population
consisted either of slaves or of churls or of villains, who were
compelled to till the ground for the benefit of their masters.
These classes immediately gained the comfort of rest, one day in
seven; and they whose labour had hitherto been unremitted, without
any pause, except when fainting nature sunk under incessant toil,
could now expect the Sabbath of the Lord, as a day of holiness and
of repose. So strictly did the temporal laws protect the observance
of the seventh day, the right and privilege of the poor, that the
master who compelled his slave to work on the Sunday, was deprived
of the means of abusing his power,&mdash;the slave obtained his
freedom.</p>
<p>A tenth part of the produce of the land was set apart for the
maintenance of the clergy, and the support of the destitute.
Charity, when resulting from the unaided impulses of humanity, has
no permanence. Bestowed merely to relieve ourselves from the
painful sight of misery, the virtue blesses neither the giver nor
the receiver. But proceeding from the love of God, it is steady and
uniform in its operation, not wayward, not lukewarm, not affected
by starts and fancies, and ministering to more than the bodily
wants of those who are in need.</p>
<p>Paupers, such as we now see, then rarely existed. Bad as it was,
the system of slavery had given a house and a home to the great
mass of the lowest orders. And the laws, which placed the middling
classes under the protection, and at the same time under the
control of the more powerful, prevented all such as really belonged
to society, from experiencing any severe privations in those years
when the people were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name=
"page303"></a>[pg 303]</span>not visited by any particular
misfortunes. But mankind were then subjected to many calamities,
which have been moderated in our times. If crops failed, and the
earth did not bring forth her fruit, vessels arrived not from
distant parts, laden with corn. Hunger wasted the land. Sickness
and pestilence followed, and thinned the remnant who had been left.
Families were broken up, and the survivors became helpless
outcasts; for the people of each country raised only as much grain
as was sufficient for their own use, and could not supply their
neighbours. War often produced still greater miseries. In all these
distresses, the spirit of Christianity constantly urged those who
were influenced by this enduring spring of action, to exert
themselves in affording relief;&mdash;to clothe the naked and feed
the hungry,&mdash;to visit the sick&mdash;and bury the corpses of
the departed.</p>
<p>The higher or ruling orders saw, in the plain letter of the
Bible, the means of amending the rude and savage laws which had
governed their forefathers; and religion also afforded the means of
improving the whole fabric of the state. In addition to their
piety, the clergy were the depositaries of all the learning of the
age. All the knowledge which distinguishes civilization from savage
life was entrusted to them. Admitted into the supreme councils of
the realm, they became an order, possessing acknowledged rights
which could not be lawfully assailed. And though they may
occasionally have attempted to extend their privileges beyond their
proper bounds, yet, in a monarchy, the existence of any one rank or
order invested with franchises which the king must not assail, is
in itself a strong and direct protection to the privileges of all
other ranks of the community. Powerful as the nobles may have been,
it is doubtful whether they could have maintained their ground, had
they been deprived of the support which they derived from the
Bishops and Abbots, who stood foremost in the ranks, amongst the
peers of the monarchy. Many a blow which would have cleft the
helmet, turned off without harm from the mitre; and the crozier
kept many an enemy at bay, who would have rushed without
apprehension upon the spear.</p>
<p>To the successors of the Anglo-Saxon prelates, we mainly owe the
preservation of the forms and spirit of a free government,
defended, not by force, but by law; and the altar may be considered
as the corner-stone of the ancient constitution of the realm.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>A snapper up of unconsidered trifles.</p>
</div>
<p>SHAKSPEARE</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>SERMONS.</h3>
<p>Mr. Northcote tells us, that a clergyman, a friend of Mr.
Opie&rsquo;s declared to him, that he once delivered one of Sir J.
Reynolds&rsquo;s discourses to the Royal Academy, from the pulpit,
as a sermon, with no other alteration but in such words as made it
applicable to morals instead of the fine arts.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SANCTUARY.</h3>
<p>What an eccentricity of wickedness was it to appoint any place
where a murderer should get shelter&mdash;a church too! but such
were, and are (abroad) called sanctuaries. Lancaster Church was
reserved by Henry VIII. as a sanctuary, after the abolition of that
dangerous privilege in the rest of England.</p>
<hr />
<h3>CHINESE INGENUITY.</h3>
<p>In making toys, the Chinese are exceedingly expert: out of a
solid ball of ivory, with a hole in it, not larger than half an
inch in diameter, they will cut from nine to fifteen distinct
hollow globes, one within another, all loose, and capable of being
turned round in every direction, and each of them carved full of
the same kind of open-work that appears on the fans; a very small
sum of money is the price of one of these difficult trifles.</p>
<hr />
<h3>LOUIS XI. AND THE VIRGIN MARY.</h3>
<p>A fool of Louis XI. to whom he did not attend, as not thinking
him capable of making observations, overheard him making this
pleasant proposal to our lady of Cleri, at the great altar, when
nobody else was in the church. &ldquo;Ah! my dear lady, my little
mistress, my best friend, my only comforter, I beg you to be my
advocate, and to importune God to pardon me the death of my
brother, whom I poisoned by the hands of that rascal, the Abbot of
St. John. I confess this to you as to my good patroness and
mistress; I know it is hard, but it will be the more glorious for
you if you obtain it, and I know what present I will make you
beside.&rdquo; (<em>See Brantome&rsquo;s Life of Charles
III</em>.)</p>
<p>The fool repeated all, word for word, when the king was at
dinner, before the whole court.</p>
<hr />
<h3>LOYAL BEQUEST.</h3>
<p>Col. Windham, who assisted Charles II. in his escape, is said to
have told the king, that Sir Thomas, his father, in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span>the
year 1636, a few days before his death, called to him his five
sons:&mdash;&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have
hitherto seen serene and quiet times under our three last
sovereigns; but I must now warn you to prepare for clouds and
storms. Factions arise on every side, and threaten the tranquillity
of your native country. But, whatever happen, <em>do you faithfully
honour and obey your prince, and adhere to the crown. I charge you
never to forsake the crown, though it should hang upon a
bush.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>SHETLAND ISLES.</h3>
<p>Here, on the shortest&mdash;day, the sun rises 17-1/2 min. past
9 o&rsquo;clock, and sets 42 min. past 2 o&rsquo;clock. The nights
begin to be very short early in May, and from the middle of that
month to the end of July, darkness is absolutely unknown&mdash;the
sun scarcely quits the horizon, and his short absence is supplied
by a bright twilight. Nothing can surpass the calm serenity of a
fine summer night in the Shetland Isles.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A SAFE WAY TO OPEN STALE OYSTERS.</h3>
<p>There is an old proverb, viz. &ldquo;<em>The Mayor of
Northampton opens oisters with his dagger</em>.&rdquo; The meaning
of which is, to keep them at a sufficient distance from his nose.
For this town being eighty miles from the sea, fish may well be
presumed stale therein. &ldquo;Yet I have heard (says Dr. Fuller,)
that oisters put up with care, and carried in the cool, were weekly
brought fresh and good to <em>Althrop</em>, the seat of the
<em>Lord Spencer</em>, at equal distance; and it is no wonder, for
I myself have eaten, in Warwickshire, above eighty miles from
London, oisters sent from that city, fresh and good, and they must
have, been carried some miles before they came there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P.T.W.</p>
<hr />
<p>Castellan, in his funeral sermon on the death of his patron,
Francis I. modestly expressed his belief that the great prince was
in paradise; this gave great offence to the Sorbonne, who
complained of it to the court of France. Their remonstrance was
coldly received, and Mendoze, who had been steward to Francis, told
them, &ldquo;that he knew the disposition of his old master better
than they, that he never could bear to remain long in one place;
and that if he had been in purgatory, he stopped there merely to
take a little refreshment, and afterwards went on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not perhaps generally known that there is a peculiar right
in the family of the Campbell&rsquo;s (Duke of Argyle) that when
they marry any of their daughters, their vassals are obliged to pay
their portions, and are taxed for such, according to the number of
their cattle.</p>
<p>This right has not, however, been acted on for a century
past.</p>

<h3>EXTRAORDINARY DISAPPEARANCE.</h3>
<p>Sir Thomas L&mdash;D sometimes, though rarely, lest his veracity
should be doubted, mentions in society the following singular
incident:&mdash;He once had upon his estate, rearing with great
care and tenderness, a young nyl ghaut, an animal rare in England,
and very elegant. One day it was taken from its stable, in order to
be exhibited to some of Sir T.L.&rsquo;s friends, when, escaping
from its keeper, it leaped over the park palings, and was never
beheld or heard of more. Horsemen were sent in search of it far and
wide, and handsome rewards were, offered by advertisement for its
recovery, but it had not, been seen by a single creature in the
fields, or on the roads, or in the villages through which it must
have passed; and of wood, and water there was not a sufficiency for
some miles in the vicinity of &mdash;&mdash; House, to conceal it,
living or dead. So, after incessant, but fruitless efforts to
obtain some intelligence respecting his beautiful and valuable
favourite, Sir T.L. was at length obliged to desist in the
prosecution of his inquiries altogether.&mdash;M.</p>

<h3>POPULAR SCIENCE.</h3>
<p>This Day is published, price 5s.</p>
<p>ARCANA of SCIENCE, and ANNUAL REGISTER of the USEFUL ARTS for
1831.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>Arcana of Art and Science</em> is the fourth
volume of a little work of the most useful and entertaining
description. It is brimful of all the new facts that have shown
themselves above ground in the course of the year. Every page is a
volume, and many contain the results of whole years of ingenious
labour and experiment. Every description of discovery, invention,
experiment, receipt, observation, or memorandum of a remarkable
occurrence in nature or art during the year, is here recorded,
briefly, but clearly.&mdash;It, in fact, is the very essence or
extract of the scientific pursuits of the whole world for one year.
All this is to be had for five shillings. We recommend it to be
laid in every place where a man may possibly lose five minutes for
want of mental occupation.&rdquo;&mdash;Spectator, April 23.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
